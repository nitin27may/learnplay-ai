**Move History Visualization**
```
Move 4: Nf6
├─ Position before
├─ Highlighted square (from)
├─ Arrow to destination
├─ Voice: "Develops the knight"
└─ Position after
```

#### Voice Explanations

**Teaching Narration Examples**:

*Opening Theory*:
> "Bishop to c4 attacks f7, the weakest square in Black's position, while developing toward the center."

*Tactical Pattern*:
> "The knight on f3 can capture on e5 and then fork the king on e7 and rook on h8."

*Positional Concept*:
> "Black's doubled pawns on the c-file are weak because they can't defend each other."

*Strategic Plan*:
> "Focus on controlling the d-file with your rooks before pushing the passed pawn."

### Teaching Session Workflow

#### Frontend Tools (Similar to Sudoku)

**1. `startChessLesson(totalSteps, topic, position?)`**
```typescript
startChessLesson({
  totalSteps: 8,
  topic: "Italian Opening",
  position: "rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1" // FEN
})
```

**2. `updateChessStep(stepNumber, stepDescription, move?)`**
```typescript
updateChessStep({
  stepNumber: 3,
  stepDescription: "Developing the knight",
  move: "Nf3" // SAN notation
})
```

**3. `highlightSquares(squares, message, arrows?, duration?)`**
```typescript
highlightSquares({
  squares: [
    { square: 'e4', color: 'green' },
    { square: 'd5', color: 'yellow' }
  ],
  arrows: [
    { from: 'e4', to: 'd5', color: 'red', label: 'threat' }
  ],
  message: "The pawn threatens to capture on d5",
  duration: 15000
})
```

**4. `showBestMoves(moves, evaluation)`**
```typescript
showBestMoves({
  moves: ['Nf6', 'Bc5', 'Qe7'],
  evaluation: ['+0.5', '+0.3', '+0.1'],
  bestMove: 'Nf6',
  explanation: "Nf6 develops with tempo"
})
```

**5. `loadPosition(fen, orientation?)`**
```typescript
loadPosition({
  fen: "r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R",
  orientation: 'white' // or 'black'
})
```

#### Agent Tools (Backend)

```python
@tool
def analyze_chess_position(fen: str) -> dict:
    """Analyzes position using Stockfish"""
    # Returns: evaluation, best moves, threats
    
@tool
def get_opening_name(moves: List[str]) -> str:
    """Identifies opening from move sequence"""
    # Returns: opening name, common variations

@tool
def explain_tactical_pattern(pattern: str, fen: str) -> dict:
    """Explains tactical motif in position"""
    # Returns: description, key squares, example

@tool
def suggest_chess_move(fen: str, skill_level: str) -> dict:
    """Suggests appropriate move for skill level"""
    # Returns: move, reasoning, alternatives

@tool
def validate_chess_move(fen: str, move: str) -> dict:
    """Checks if move is legal and evaluates it"""
    # Returns: validity, evaluation, better alternatives

@tool
def get_endgame_tablebase(fen: str) -> dict:
    """Queries endgame tablebase for perfect play"""
    # Returns: outcome (win/draw/loss), optimal line
```
